## Code Example/Issues 🔍

My biggest issue was to implement mouse wheel feature. I found prepared function for that.

```bash
function throttle(func, limit) {
    let inThrottle;
    return function() {
      const args = arguments;
      const context = this;
      if (!inThrottle) {
        func.apply(context, args);
        inThrottle = true;
        setTimeout(() => (inThrottle = false), limit);
      }
    };
  }
```

## Installation 📍
